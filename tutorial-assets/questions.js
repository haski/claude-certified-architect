      "Add few-shot examples",
      "Implement a routing classifier"

    explanation: "This applies the principle of least privilege: the synthesis agent gets exactly what it needs for the 85% common case (simple fact checks) while preserving the coordinator-mediated path for complex investigations. B introduces blocking dependencies (later synthesis steps may depend on earlier verified facts). C breaks separation of responsibilities. D relies on speculative caching that cannot reliably predict needs."

Claude currently serves two workflows in real time: (1) a blocking pre-merge check that must complete before developers can merge a PR, and (2) a tech-debt report generated overnight for morning review.

    prompt: "How should you evaluate this proposal?",

      "Move both to batch processing with a fallback to real time if a batch takes too long"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The Message Batches API saves 50%, but processing time can be up to 24 hours with no guaranteed latency SLA. That makes it unsuitable for blocking pre-merge checks where developers are waiting, but ideal for overnight batch workloads like tech-debt reports."

    situation: "A pull request changes 14 files in an inventory tracking module. A single-pass review of all files produces inconsistent results: detailed comments for some files but superficial ones for others, missed obvious bugs, and contradictory feedback (a pattern is flagged as problematic in one file but approved in identical code in another file).",
    prompt: "How should you restructure the review?",
    options: [
      "Split into focused passes: analyze each file individually for local issues, then run a separate integration pass for cross-file data flows",
      "Require developers to split large PRs into submissions of 3-4 files",

      "Run three independent full-PR review passes and report only issues found in at least two runs"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Focused passes directly address the root cause—attention dilution when processing many files at once. Per-file analysis ensures consistent depth, and a separate integration pass catches cross-file issues. B shifts burden to developers without improving the system. C is a misconception: larger context does not fix attention quality. D suppresses real bugs by requiring consensus across inconsistent detections."

    situation: "A document analysis agent discovers that two credible sources contain directly contradictory statistics for a key metric: a government report states 40% growth, while an industry analysis states 12%. Both sources look credible, and the discrepancy could materially affect the research conclusions. How should the document analysis agent handle this situation most effectively?",
    prompt: "Which approach is most effective?",
    options: [
      "Apply credibility heuristics to pick the most likely correct number, finish analysis with that value, and add a footnote mentioning the discrepancy.",

    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "This approach preserves separation of responsibilities: the analysis agent completes its core work without blocking, preserves both conflicting values with clear attribution, and correctly passes reconciliation to the coordinator, which has broader context."

    situation: "A document analysis subagent frequently fails when processing PDF files: some have corrupted sections that trigger parsing exceptions, others are password-protected, and sometimes the parsing library hangs on large files. Currently, any exception immediately terminates the subagent and returns an error to the coordinator, which must decide whether to retry, skip, or fail the whole task. This causes excessive coordinator involvement in routine error handling. What architectural improvement is most effective?",
    prompt: "Which improvement is most effective?",
    options: [
      "Create a dedicated error-handling agent that monitors all failures via a shared queue and decides recovery actions, sending restart commands directly to subagents.",

      "Make the coordinator validate all documents before sending them to the subagent, rejecting documents that might cause failures.",
      "Implement local recovery in the subagent for transient failures and escalate to the coordinator only errors it cannot resolve, including attempted steps and partial results."

    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Handle errors at the lowest level capable of resolving them. Local recovery reduces coordinator workload while still escalating truly unrecoverable issues with full context and partial progress."

However, final reports cover only visual art and completely miss music, literature, and film. In the coordinator logs, you see it decomposed the topic into three subtasks: \"AI in digital art,\" \"AI in graphic design,\" and \"AI in photography.\" What is the most likely root cause?",
    prompt: "What is the most likely root cause?",
    options: [
      "The synthesis agent lacks instructions to detect coverage gaps.",

      "The web-search agent's queries are insufficient and should be broadened to cover more sectors."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "The coordinator decomposed a broad topic only into visual-art subtasks, missing music, literature, and film entirely. Since subagents executed their assignments correctly, the narrow decomposition is the obvious root cause."

    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Renaming the web-search tool to extract_web_results and updating its description to explicitly reference web search and URLs directly removes the root cause by eliminating semantic overlap between the two tool names and descriptions.

    explanation: "Returning structured error context—including failure type, executed query, partial results, and alternative approaches—gives the coordinator everything needed to make intelligent recovery decisions (e.g., retry with a modified query or continue with partial results).

    explanation: "A 2,800-token system prompt with declarative rules is vulnerable to drift because abstract rules require the model to reason about them on every turn. Replacing verbose rules with concrete few-shot examples that demonstrate correct proficiency-level adaptation gives the model clear behavioral patterns to match—this is more reliably followed across many turns than abstract instructions. Reminder injection (A) helps but addresses symptoms; end-placement (C) helps initially but not with turn-level drift; regeneration (D) is expensive and corrective."

The model increasingly pattern-matches to its own prior outputs rather than the system prompt, compounding drift even at short token lengths.
